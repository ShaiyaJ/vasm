# VASM
## About
Vasm means "Visual Assembly". Originally I was going to turn LMC (a popular tool in England for teaching ~14-16 year olds about Von Neumann architecture) into it's own block-based language. Something akin to Scratch but for assembly.

As the project continued I resorted more for emulating LMC and adding more modern CSS. And I toyed with the idea of basing it more around Harvard architecture (since there is no tools similar to LMC for that).

It features:
- The same instruction set and syntax as LMC (https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/help.html)
- Expandable memory (start off at 0-99 but you can allocate up to an effectively-limitless number of cells)
- 64-bit integer limit for each register/memory location
- More modern UI
- Ability to hide parts of the UI
- In-app documentation, lessons and example programs
- Saving/loading programs to and from a .txt file

My blog is a much better place to look at for more details about the project itself and the aims of the app. Unlike some of my other apps, this isn't really a utility I wrote with the intention of people using as a day-to-day thing. This is more of a curiosity or a learning tool for students. In England we don't cover this topic in depth, no super-complex tasks are written using this. 

## Development
Development on this project will end after the due date for my project on 2024/03/16. After this point development will be done in my own free time for my own enjoyment. I started writing this project before my "timeboxing" project, so I had no experience with using React before this point. I've made mistakes in the setup and code that I would deem incredibly difficult to fix, and since this project is just for school I don't think I will ever get around to refactoring this project.
